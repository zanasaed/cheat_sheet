In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms:Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character isthus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people. Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them fromtime to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. Wehave reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here.
